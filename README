MochiWeb is an Erlang library for building lightweight HTTP servers.

The latest version of MochiWeb is available at http://github.com/mochi/mochiweb

R12B compatibility:
The master of MochiWeb is tested with R13B04 and later. A branch compatible
with R12B is maintained separately at http://github.com/lemenkov/mochiweb
The R12B branch of that repository is mirrored in the official repository
occasionally for convenience.
